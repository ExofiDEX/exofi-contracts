## Address

_Collection of functions related to the address type_

***

### Functions

#### functionCall

```solidity
function functionCall(address target, bytes data) internal returns (bytes)
```

_Performs a Solidity function call using a low level `call`. A
plain `call` is an unsafe replacement for a function call: use this
function instead.

If `target` reverts with a revert reason, it is bubbled up by this
function (like regular Solidity function calls).

Returns the raw returned data. To convert to the expected return value,
use https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/units-and-global-variables.html?highlight=abi.decode#abi-encoding-and-decoding-functions[`abi.decode`].

Requirements:

- `target` must be a contract.
- calling `target` with `data` must not revert.

_Available since v3.1.__

#### functionCall

```solidity
function functionCall(address target, bytes data, string errorMessage) internal returns (bytes)
```

_Same as {xref-Address-functionCall-address-bytes-}[`functionCall`], but with
`errorMessage` as a fallback revert reason when `target` reverts.

_Available since v3.1.__

#### functionCallWithValue

```solidity
function functionCallWithValue(address target, bytes data, uint256 value) internal returns (bytes)
```

_Same as {xref-Address-functionCall-address-bytes-}[`functionCall`],
but also transferring `value` wei to `target`.

Requirements:

- the calling contract must have an ETH balance of at least `value`.
- the called Solidity function must be `payable`.

_Available since v3.1.__

#### functionCallWithValue

```solidity
function functionCallWithValue(address target, bytes data, uint256 value, string errorMessage) internal returns (bytes)
```

_Same as {xref-Address-functionCallWithValue-address-bytes-uint256-}[`functionCallWithValue`], but
with `errorMessage` as a fallback revert reason when `target` reverts.

_Available since v3.1.__

#### isContract

```solidity
function isContract(address account) internal view returns (bool)
```

_Returns true if `account` is a contract.

[IMPORTANT]
====
It is unsafe to assume that an address for which this function returns
false is an externally-owned account (EOA) and not a contract.

Among others, `isContract` will return false for the following
types of addresses:

 - an externally-owned account
 - a contract in construction
 - an address where a contract will be created
 - an address where a contract lived, but was destroyed
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
You shouldn't rely on `isContract` to protect against flash loan attacks!

Preventing calls from contracts is highly discouraged. It breaks composability, breaks support for smart wallets
like Gnosis Safe, and does not provide security since it can be circumvented by calling from a contract
constructor.
====_

#### verifyCallResult

```solidity
function verifyCallResult(bool success, bytes returndata, string errorMessage) internal pure returns (bytes)
```

_Tool to verifies that a low level call was successful, and revert if it wasn't, either by bubbling the
revert reason using the provided one.

_Available since v4.3.__
